# aboutme

My very first project in Flutter.

it is a simlpe app named "About Me" and information app that allows users to create and store multiple personal contact profiles on their mobile devices. Users can add personal details such as name, age, birthdate, address, and hobbies, even Images! and they can also add a profile picture for their contacts. The app will have a simple and intuitive interface to make it easy for users to navigate and add/edit their profiles.

I used Firebase Auth, Firestore for database, Firestorage for image uploads.
